# ModeratorBot_BETA Discord.js[V12]
A moderation bot for now with 3 commands 
- **kick**

The bot is in beta, which means it will gradually improve.

- If you did not write a reason for the sanction, the bot will send you an embed with an error
- If the person who is executing the command or the bot does not have permissions, the bot will send an embed with an error
- When sanctioning a user, it will send an embed with the following text "**{user} has been successfully banned.**"

# Bot features:
- It is made with commandhandler
- It has a default prefix "**-**"
- Ignore all bot commands
- Ignore DM commands or messages

# To-do list:
- [ ] Mute & unmute command ([#3](https://github.com/AllanGame/ModeratorBOT-Discord.js-V12-/issues/3/))
- [ ] Auto mod
- [ ] Filter bad words

I have not had time to update much of this bot but I will try to update it more later :)
